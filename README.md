# Real or Fake: The Imposter Hunt in Texts

## Kaggle Competition Description
"The main task of this competition is to detect fake texts in a given dataset. Each data sample contains two texts - one real and one fake. ... Importantly, both texts in each sample - real (optimal for the recipient, as close as possible to the hidden original text) and fake (more or much more distant from the hidden original text) - have been significantly modified using LLMs." Find out more information about the competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-or-real-the-impostor-hunt/overview).
